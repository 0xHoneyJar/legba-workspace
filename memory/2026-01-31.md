## PR #73 - Autonomous Agent Skill (Major Work)

Comprehensive meta-orchestrator incorporating solutions from @zkSoju's issues:

### Issue Integrations
- **#70** construct.yaml - Full manifest with skills, versions, execution order
- **#71** Unix Philosophy - Input/output contracts, exit codes, checkpoints
- **#29** PRD Iteration - Phase 7 gap check, auto /refine-prd
- **#48** Feedback Protocol - Structured YAML learnings upstream
- **#23** NOTES.md cleanup - Typed notes with expiry

### Key Features Added
- Operator detection (AI vs human auto-detection)
- 8-phase execution with quality gates
- Remediation loops (max 3, then escalate)
- construct.yaml for skill packaging

## Important Architecture Clarification from Jani

**Sequential at HIGH level**: PRD → SDD → Sprint → Implement → Audit (THE FLOW)
**Iterative WITHIN phases**: Review cycles, drafts, multi-AI council

### Multi-AI Review Council (Future)
- GPT-5.2 for failure risk detection (branch: feature/gpt-5.2-cross-model-review)
- NotebookLM for grounded context assessment
- Internal loops within phases, not separate steps

```
Claude produces → GPT reviews → NotebookLM grounds → Claude fixes → Re-review

## Cron Jobs Set Up

1. `autonomous-work-directive` - Every 6 hours
2. `pr-review-check` - Every 4 hours (PRs AND issues I've commented on)

## Issues Contributed To

| Issue | Topic | My Input |
|-------|-------|----------|
| #54 | Agent Readiness | Operator detection config |
| #48 | Feedback Protocol | AI feedback schema |
| #71 | Unix Philosophy | Pipeline composition |
| #70 | construct.yaml | Autonomous agent as construct |
| #43 | Grimoire Reality | Clawdbot analysis evidence |
| #29 | PRD Iteration | Firsthand friction feedback |

## Responses Received

@zkSoju responded on #70:
- Order is recommendation, not requirement
- Constructs are playgrounds for exploration
- Referenced private forge repo for construct patterns

I responded acknowledging the flexibility while noting AI operators benefit from stricter guardrails.

## Key Learnings

1. **PRs need autonomous disclosure** - All PRs now include "⚠️ Autonomous Contribution Disclosure"
2. **Check issues too, not just PRs** - Nearly missed zkSoju's response
3. **Work freely, review daily** - No artificial task limits, Jani reviews costs
4. **Cross-reference existing issues** - My PRs should relate to open issues

## Repository State

- Fork: `janitooor/legba` (my homepage)
- Upstream: `0xHoneyJar/loa` (PRs go here)
- Clawdbot fork: `janitooor/openclaw`

## Assessment Architecture Groundwork (PR #73 Update)

Added comprehensive assessment design documentation to PR #73:

### Key Design Elements
1. **Five Assessment Gates**: Selection → Precondition → Execution → Output → Goal
2. **Unix Exit Code Semantics**: 0=success, 1-3 soft fail, 64-78 precondition, 80-99 skill-specific
3. **Execution Result Contract**: Structured TypeScript interface for all skill outputs
4. **Handoff Protocol**: Phase transitions as Gate 3 (output) + Gate 1 (precondition) validation
5. **Data Capture Model**: JSONL traces, "capture now, analyze later" principle

### Design Principle
Lay the pipes and define contracts now. Scoring engine comes later but needs these interfaces.

### Files Created
- `/root/clawd/knowledge/ASSESSMENT-DESIGN.md` (full 22KB design doc)
- Updated PR #73 description with assessment architecture section
- Added detailed comment with design rationale

## Decision Record: Exit Codes

**DECISION-001**: Loa skills use Unix-style exit codes (0/1/2 minimal, sysexits.h if extended needed).

Reasoning:
- CLI context (Claude Code) — Unix codes work natively
- No dominant agentic standard exists (surveyed MCP, OpenAI, Google, Vercel)
- MCP uses JSON-RPC but only for protocol errors, not skill success/failure
- Don't invent new standard — wait for ecosystem convergence

If MCP interface added later: wrap exit codes in JSON-RPC error responses.

Full decision: `/root/clawd/knowledge/DECISION-001-EXIT-CODES.md`

## Related Issues Commented On

Connected new @zkSoju issues to PR #73 assessment architecture:

| Issue | Topic | Connection |
|-------|-------|------------|
| #74 | QMD auto-indexing | Solves Gate 0 (skill selection) with measurable confidence |
| #75 | Invisible activation | Reframes Gate 0 as intent inference → skill match |
| #76 | Oracle learnings | Recursive feedback loop, compound learning |

Key insight from #75: "The problem isn't skill quality—it's skill activation." This validates the gate model focus.

## Clawdbot Fork Created

**https://github.com/0xHoneyJar/clawdbot**

Forked from `openclaw/openclaw`. Purpose: faster iteration on my runtime without waiting for upstream.

PRs now go to:
- **Loa framework**: `0xHoneyJar/loa`
- **My runtime**: `0xHoneyJar/clawdbot`

Planned runtime improvements:
- Structured execution logging (JSONL traces, opt-in)
- Skill result capture with exit code semantics
- Handoff validation hooks
- Assessment gate instrumentation

## Next Steps

1. Submit first PR to 0xHoneyJar/clawdbot with Loa-specific hooks
2. Consider adding multi-AI review hooks to PR #73
3. Look at NotebookLM skill for grounded assessment integration
4. Continue monitoring PRs/issues for responses
5. Pick up backlog items (W-005, W-006, etc.)
